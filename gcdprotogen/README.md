# Google Chrome Debugger (GCD) Protocol Generator
You should hopefully not have to use this, but this package is for generating commands and types (soon events maybe) for the Google Chrome Debugger Service for remotely debugging a Chrome Process.

Basically it reads in the protocol.json file, does some gnarly processing and spits out the code & types using templates. You'll notice the type spitting out code is a horrible hack because i didn't know how to use templates very well.

Code templates are a bit cleaner but a lot is left to be desired, mainly there is a lot of repeat structs i could replace and I could make the template a bit cleaner but guess what? I did this in like 2 days so gimmie a break.

Updated September 2015 with latest protocol.json
