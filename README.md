# Google Chrome Debugger (GCD)
This is primarly an auto-generated client library for communicating with a Google Chrome Browser over their [remote client debugger protocol](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/debugger-protocol). Note that their documentation is partially incorrect and does not contain a lot of the API calls that are actually available.

Because I'm lazy and there are hundereds of different custom types and API methods, this library has been automatically generated using their [protocol.json](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/third_party/WebKit/Source/devtools/protocol.json&q=protocol.json&sq=package:chromium&type=cs). What this means is probably a lot of stuff doesn't work. 

The [gcdprotogen](https://github.com/wirepair/gcd/gcdprotogen) package was created to generate types and commands for gcd. Non-biolerplate code (and the majority of the logic) are in [gcd.go](https://github.com/wirepair/gcd/blob/master/gcd.go) and [chrome_target.go](https://github.com/wirepair/gcd/blob/master/chrome_target.go).

## The API
The API consists of three types, synchronous requests, asynchronous requests and events. Synchronous requests are handled by using non-buffered channels and methods can be called and will return once the value is available. Asynchronous requests have not been heavily tested. Events are handled by subscribing the response method type and calling the API's "Enable()" such as:
```Go
	console := targets[0].Console()
	targets[0].Subscribe("Console.messageAdded", func(target *ChromeTarget, v []byte) {
		msg := &EventData{}
		err := json.Unmarshal(v, msg)
		if err != nil {
			log.Fatalf("error unmarshalling event data: %v\n", err)
		}
		fmt.Printf("METHOD: %s\n", msg.Method)
		eventData := msg.Params.Message
		fmt.Printf("Got event: %v\n", eventData)
		fmt.Printf("Timestamp: %f\n", *eventData.Timestamp)
	})
	console.Enable()
	// recv events
	console.Disable()
```
In the future there are plans to make event handling easier, but for now you'll need to know the event type and unmarshall it yourself. If you are unsure of what events will come in, i've helpfully left in debugging messages saying unable to dispatch event and give the full dump :>. This is alpha code at best so use caution.


## Usage
If you need to create complex types, you'll need to import the "github.com/wirepair/gcd/gcdprotogen/types" library. It contains all of the types the chrome remote debugger protocol uses. If you are just accessing them from return values it should not be necessary to import.

Loading a page using the Page API.
```Go
package main

import (
	"github.com/wirepair/gcd"
	"log"
	"sync"
)

func main() {
	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	wg.Add(1)
	debugger := gcd.NewChromeDebugger()
	// start process, specify a tmp profile path so we get a fresh profiled browser
	// set port 9222 as the debug port
	debugger.StartProcess("C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe", "C:\\tmp\\", "9222")
	defer debugger.ExitProcess() // exit when done
	targets := debugger.GetTargets() // get the 'targets' or tabs/background processes
	target := targets[0] // take the first one

	//subscribe to page load
	target.Subscribe("Page.loadEventFired", func(targ *gcd.ChromeTarget, v []byte) {
		wg.Done() // page loaded, we can exit now
		// if you wanted to inspect the full response data, you could do that here, or unmarshal it 
		// if you know the proper type
	})
	page := target.Page() // get the Page API
	page.Enable() // Enable so we can recv events
	ret, err := page.Navigate("http://www.veracode.com") // navigate
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Error navigating: %s\n", err)
	}
	log.Printf("ret: %#v\n", ret)
	wg.Wait() // wait for page load
}

```
Getting a document from a target.
```Go
package main

import (
	"github.com/wirepair/gcd"
	"log"
)

func main() {
	debugger := gcd.NewChromeDebugger()
	debugger.StartProcess("C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe", "C:\\tmp\\", "9222")
	defer debugger.ExitProcess()
	targets := debugger.GetTargets()
	target := targets[0]
	dom := target.DOM()
	r, err := dom.GetDocument()
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("error: %s\n", err)
	}

	log.Printf("NodeID: %d Node Name: %s, URL: %s\n", *r.NodeId, r.NodeName, r.DocumentURL)
}
```

Create a new tab and start working with it
```Go
package main

import (
	"github.com/wirepair/gcd"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	debugger := gcd.NewChromeDebugger()
	debugger.StartProcess("C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe", "C:\\tmp\\", "9222")
	defer debugger.ExitProcess()
	target := debugger.NewTab()
	page := target.Page()
	page.Navigate("https://github.com/wirepair/gcd")
	time.Sleep(5 * time.Second)
}
```
